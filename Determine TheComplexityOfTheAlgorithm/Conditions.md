						Determine the complexity of the algorithm

	1.Does a number belong to an array

Determine the complexity (maximum number of steps) of the algorithm:
Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of integers on one line separated by a space and on the second line a number that is checked to see if it exists in the array on the first line.  If the number exists in the array, "{number} Exists in the List" is output, otherwise "{Number} Not exists in the List" is output.

	2.Insert method 

Determine the complexity (maximum number of steps) of the algorithm:
Write a program that reads from the console an ascending sequence of integers on one line separated by a space and on the second line a number that is inserted at such a position that the newly obtained array is again ascending. Output:
The newly obtained array
The two arrays, the one before the insertion and the other after the insertion

	3.Searching the ordered array 
	
Determine the complexity (maximum number of steps) of the algorithm:
Write a program that reads from the console an ascending sequence of integers on one line separated by a space and on the second line a number that is checked to see if it exists in the array of the first line.  If the number exists in the array, "{number} Exists in the List" is output, otherwise "{Number} Not exists in the List" is output.

	4.Sum and Average
	
Determine the complexity (maximum number of steps) of the algorithm:
Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of numbers (on a single line, separated by a space). Calculate and print the sum and average of the elements of the sequence. Saves the sequence in List<int>. Round the average to the second digit after the decimal separator.
Input 	Output
4 5 6 	Sum=15; Average=5.00
1 1 	Sum=2; Average=1.00
	Sum=0; Average=0.00
10 	Sum=10; Average=10.00
2 2 1 	Sum=5; Average=1.67
